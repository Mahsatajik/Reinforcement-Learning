class Agent():
    # TODO: Define the DQN Agent here.
    #
    # Hints: 1- Initialize a Neural Network (using DeepNetwork class),
    #           and other essential parameters in the init method.
    #        2- Define a method for taking action using 
    #           epsilon-greedy policy based on the DQN outputs.
    #        3- Define a learning method for updating DQN weights.
    #        4- You may also need to define some extra methods
    #           for decrementing epsilon, saving, and loading a trained network.
